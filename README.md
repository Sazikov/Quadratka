# Square equation solver

## What was the project created for?
This project was created to solve square equation. To do this, I used C programming language. 

## What data is beeng submitted for input? 
Coefficienys a, b, c are served to the input. As a result of the program, the roots of the equation and their number are displaed on the screen.

## How does the program works?
The entered coefficients are analyzed and, depending on the result of the analysis, the roots of the equation are calculated.

## How should you run the program?
1. You need to download [files](https://github.com/Sazikov/Quadratka) from github. 
2. You need to transfer files to one directory. 
3. You need to open comand line (cmd) and specify address in the directory with files. (Enter **cd** and **directory adress**) *Example: cd C:\Users\max\Desktop\Quadratka*
