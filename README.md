# Square equation solver

## Intoduction
This project was created to solve square equation. To do this, I used C programming language. 

You enter coefficients a, b, c. The entered coefficients are analyzed and, depending on the result of the analysis, the roots of the equation are calculated. As a result of the program, the roots of the equation and their number are displaed on the screen.

## How should you run the program?
1. Download [files](https://github.com/Sazikov/Quadratka/blob/main/Square_equation_solver.zip) from github. 
2. Transfer files to one directory. 
3. Open comand line (cmd) and specify address in the directory with files. (Enter **cd** and **directory adress**) *Example: cd C:\Users\max\Desktop\Quadratka*
4. Compile program (Enter **make**) and run program (**Enter main.exe**)
5. Enter **a**, **b**, **c** coefficients.

### What else you need to know:
- If you want to run Unit test, you should uncomment 6 line (**#define Test**)
- [Documentation](https://github.com/Sazikov/Quadratka/blob/main/Documentation.zip)
